Practical Machine Learning
==========================

Project
-------

This is my project for the Coursera's Practical Machine Learning course.

Since github tends to show the html __source__ instead of rendering the content you want to prepend `http://htmlpreview.githug.com?` to the url to read the html file.

So to read the analysis click on: 
http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/herchu1/PracticalMachineLearning/blob/master/PML-project.html
